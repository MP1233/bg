3D data on neurons in rat brains exist. However these data are sparse and real 3D are not perfect for illustrative purposes. This project uses most typical neurons, topology and quantity data. Also this project models neuron with missing 3D data. topographical projections with color schemes and scaling (such as 1:10000 displaying 1 from 10000 neurons) added<br>
One of the aims is to make illustrator software that can be used for textbooks and presentation customizable illustrations. Dynamics and elements of interactive simulations might be added to illustrate processes described in research publications

 human cortex is 6 layered structure with primary and interneuron types studied. many of such types of neurons are already modelled in hoc, neuroML etc datasets. also there are many microcircuits models which describe how neocortex layers neurons are connected with each other. To test hypothesis how logic tasks are performed via such network, research on how these microcircuits function and simulation of different tasks is done via modelling. Number of models as well as software that perform such simulations exist (NEURON, NetPyne)<br>
 one of examples of tasks that human brain can perform - summing or substracting 2 values. although it is clear that such calculations are more complex and widespread across different areas of the brain, the purpose of this work is to implement a purely hypothetical microcircuit for simple calculations using already existing models of neocortex neurons to see how such microcircuit will appear in 3D. also to adjust such microcircuit to known charateristics of 6 layered structure, such as synapses and cell types density in the layers<br>
 although none of the microcircuits is supposed to work as a math calculator, it is quite possible that neocortex can use some of similar algorythms for some of its calculations. especially this model performs calculations in the context of interactive input of values and operators which will involve communications between neighbouring areas. the purpose is to approximize how well can such type of algorythm fit the cortex 6 layered structure morphology<br>

also this work can be used as practical experience with different neuroML, hoc, py type simulators (NEURON & NetPyne). most attention is done to adjusting synaptic mechanisms and HH parameters task

In the first part "SUMM BLOCK" is provided with architecture that simply activates "summ RESULT neuron" when two value neurons "COMPONENT1 & 2" start firing. Also optimal filter mechanism is selected at this step. In the second part "CONTEXT BLOCK" is added to the scheme. This context block processes input from user and sends it to "SUMM BLOCK". 2 blocks are connected via BG and thalamus part. Their addition allows to process more complex formulas such as A + B - C + D =. User input is similar to standart calculator interface. Third part replaces logical scheme with "ball & stick neurons" in netpyne simulation software and further with real neocortex neuron models from EPFL data. Classical neocortex layer networks are used to transform logical schemes onto neocortex 3D volume. Different data input will be tested from pulse to tonic input. Fourth chapter compares synapse and cell locations densities with statistics from neocortex

Further research is planned for a number of different logical computing tasks to compare which of them best fit cortex layers framework

<h3>3 machine learning cortex layer structure genesis</h3>

the purpose is to estimate how different machine learning softwares can be helpful in modelling of growing cortex layered structures.
also estimation of how data quality can improve predictions.<br>
 Learning should predict next cell coordinates and gene expression profile [or 2 cells in case of cell division] from previous coordinates and profiles<br>
<i>x,y,z,gene_expression = f (x y z g_e) + cell division data + surrounding cells types/density etc</i>

Different researches use different methods on different areas of the brain. It would be ... to structurize data and develop a number of analytic tools to combine results from methods such as [whole-cell recordings, Golgi, or HRP staining, Immunofluorescence, caged glutamate, Voltage-sensitive dye, etc] to better quantify connections between types of neurons in cortex and number of synapses. simple demo of one of such possible tools URL is provided
